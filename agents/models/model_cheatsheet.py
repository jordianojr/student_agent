                    AWS Cloud computing services are categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), with AWS managing the underlying infrastructure for IaaS and providing tools for PaaS and SaaS.. AWS Cloud computing services are categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), with AWS managing the underlying infrastructure for IaaS and providing tools for PaaS and SaaS.
                    The AWS shared responsibility model defines that AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and physical facilities), while customers are responsible for security in the cloud (applications, data, configurations, and access controls).. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS Cloud services. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the bare metal host operating system and hypervisor virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the services operate. The customer is responsible for security of everything they put in the cloud. The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit. The customer should also ensure that the network is configured for security and that security credentials and logins are managed safely.
                    "AWS manages the virtualization layer, including hypervisors, operating systems, and the physical security of data centers, ensuring compliance with global standards for infrastructure protection.. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate. AWS is responsible for the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, including: Physical security of data centers with controlled, need-based access; located in nondescript facilities, with 24/7 security guards; two-factor authentication; access logging and review; video surveillance; and disk degaussing and destruction."
                    Customers are responsible for securing their own applications, data, and configurations, including encryption, access controls, and patch management for operating systems and software running on AWS resources.. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit. The customer is responsible for securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources. The customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches). The customer is responsible for managing critical content security requirements, including: What content they choose to store on AWS... The customer is responsible for the VPC configurations that specify the network conditions in which the Amazon EC2 instance runs. The customer is responsible for S3 bucket access configuration.
                    AWS provides managed services like Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora, which handle database management tasks (patches, backups, scaling) for customers, reducing their operational overhead.. If the database runs as an Amazon RDS instance, then it is the responsibility of AWS to apply Oracle software upgrades and patches. Because Amazon RDS is a managed database offering, time-consuming database administration tasks—which include provisioning, backups, software patching, monitoring, and hardware scaling—are handled by AWS.
                    Customers must configure security groups, network settings, and VPC configurations to isolate and protect their resources, such as EC2 instances and databases, within AWS.. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. The customer is also responsible for the VPC configurations that specify the network conditions in which the Amazon EC2 instance runs.
                    Amazon S3 bucket access configurations are fully under customer control, requiring explicit permissions management to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.. S3 bucket access configuration? ANSWER: The customer
                    "Physical security of AWS data centers, including 24/7 surveillance, biometric access, and facility security, is managed entirely by AWS to protect customer resources.. AWS is responsible for the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, including: Physical security of data centers with controlled, need-based access; located in nondescript facilities, with 24/7 security guards; two-factor authentication; access logging and review; video surveillance; and disk degaussing and destruction."
                    Customers are responsible for applying operating system updates, security patches, and firewall rules (e.g., security groups) for EC2 instances and other compute resources.. The customer is responsible for selecting and securing any instance operating systems, securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources, security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management. The customer must manage the guest operating system (OS) that runs on the EC2 instance. Over time, the guest OS will need to be upgraded and have security patches applied. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance.
                    AWS manages the virtualization infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, Docker containers) and ensures the security of the underlying hardware and software layers, while customers manage application-level security.. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS Cloud services.
                    "For databases, if hosted on Amazon RDS (a managed service), AWS applies patches and upgrades; if hosted on EC2, the customer is responsible for database maintenance and security.. If the database runs on an EC2 instance, then it is the customer's responsibility to apply Oracle software upgrades and patches. AWS is responsible for... applying Oracle software upgrades and patches."
                    The customer’s responsibility includes encrypting data at rest and in transit, managing encryption keys, and ensuring compliance with data residency and privacy regulations.. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit.
                    AWS provides tools like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to help customers enforce granular access controls, but ultimate configuration and management are the customer’s responsibility.. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. The customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches). S3 bucket access configuration? ANSWER: The customer.
                    Customers must configure and maintain network security settings, including subnets, routing tables, and firewall rules, to protect their resources within AWS.. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. The customer is responsible for the VPC configurations that specify the network conditions in which the Amazon EC2 instance runs.
                    AWS’s security responsibilities extend to monitoring and maintaining the global infrastructure, including redundant systems, intrusion detection, and network segmentation, to ensure service availability and resilience.. AWS also continuously monitors the network at external boundaries, secures access points, and provides redundant infrastructure with intrusion detection.
                    Customers are responsible for ensuring the security of their applications, including code audits, vulnerability assessments, and secure coding practices, even when deployed on AWS.. The customer is responsible for securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources. Customer responsibilities include selecting and securing any instance operating systems, securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources, security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management.
                    AWS’s compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) ensure infrastructure security, but customers must implement additional controls tailored to their specific use cases and regulatory requirements.. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate. The customer is responsible for security in the cloud AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS Cloud services.
                    The shared responsibility model emphasizes that AWS secures the environment, while customers secure the data and applications within that environment, requiring collaboration between both parties.. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud Customer is responsible for security in the cloud The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS.
                    AWS provides managed services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS) that abstract infrastructure complexity, allowing customers to focus on application logic without managing underlying compute or storage.. AWS Lambda: Fully managed serverless compute... AWS manage the device node, OS execution environment and application/framework execution environment (e.g., JDK). You execute your programs within their application/framework execution environment. Amazon Elastic Container Services (ECS): Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers. Amazon ECS enables you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud... AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate.
                    Customers must ensure proper configuration of AWS services (e.g., IAM roles, VPC settings) to prevent misconfigurations that could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.. The customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches). The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. S3 bucket access configuration? ANSWER: The customer

                    Week 2:
                    **TCP Three-Way Handshake**: Establishes a reliable connection between a client (e.g., Bob’s browser) and a server (e.g., Google’s HTTP server) by exchanging SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK segments. This ensures data integrity and ordered delivery.. Bob’s laptop thus first creates a TCP SYN segment with destination port 80 (for HTTP), places the TCP segment inside an IP datagram with a destination IP address of 64.233.169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch. A TCP SYNACK (Section 3.5.6) segment is generated, placed inside a datagram addressed to Bob’s laptop, and finally placed inside a link-layer frame appropriate for the link connecting www.google.com to its first-hop router. The datagram containing the TCP SYNACK segment is forwarded through the Google, Comcast, and school networks, eventually arriving at the Ethernet card in Bob’s laptop. The datagram is demultiplexed within the operating system to the TCP socket created in step 18, which enters the connected state.
                    "**DNS Resolution**: Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 64.233.169.105) using DNS queries, which are sent to a DNS server (e.g., the gateway router’s DNS address from DHCP).. the operating system on Bob’s laptop thus creates a DNS query message (Section 2.5.3), putting the string ""www.google.com"" in the question section of the DNS message. this DNS message is then placed within a UDP segment with a destination port of 53 (DNS server). The UDP segment is then placed within an IP datagram with an IP destination address of 68.87.71.226 (the address of the DNS server returned in the DHCP ACK in step 5) and a source IP address of 68.85.2.101. Bob’s laptop then places the datagram containing the DNS query message in an Ethernet frame. This frame will be sent (addressed, at the link layer) to the gateway router in Bob’s school’s network."
                    **ARP for MAC Address Discovery**: Resolves the MAC address of a gateway router (e.g., 68.85.2.1) by sending an ARP request broadcast, which the router replies to with its MAC address.. Bob’s laptop will need to use the ARP protocol (Section 6.4.1). Bob’s laptop creates an ARP query message with a target IP address of 68.85.2.1 (the default gateway), places the ARP message within an Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) and sends the Ethernet frame to the switch, which delivers the frame to all connected devices, including the gateway router. The gateway router receives the frame containing the ARP query message on the interface to the school network, and finds that the target IP address of 68.85.2.1 in the ARP message matches the IP address of its interface. The gateway router thus prepares an ARP reply, indicating that its MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B corresponds to IP address 68.85.2.1. It places the ARP reply message in an Ethernet frame, with a destination address of 00:16:D3:23:68:8A (Bob’s laptop) and sends the frame to the switch, which delivers the frame to Bob’s laptop.
                    **DHCP IP Assignment**: Allocates an IP address (e.g., 68.85.2.101) and DNS server information to a client (e.g., Bob’s laptop) to enable network communication and name resolution.. Bob’s laptop then records its IP address and the IP address of its DNS server. Bob’s DHCP client then records its IP address and the IP address of its DNS server. It also installs the address of the default gateway into its IP forwarding table.
                    **Layered vs. Tiered Architecture**: Layers (e.g., application, transport, network, data link, physical) are logical, while tiers (e.g., core, distribution, access) are physical. Layers can exist within tiers but not vice versa.. Layered are logical, tiered are physical. C/S? Layers can exist inside a tiered but not the other way Layered are usually drawn vertically stacked (except for cross cutting layers). Tiered are usually drawn horizontally across.
                    **Network Stack Structure**: The TCP/IP model consists of layers (application, transport, internet, network access) that stack vertically, with each layer handling specific functions (e.g., TCP for reliable data transfer, IP for routing).. Layered are logical, tiered are physical. C/S? Layers can exist inside a tiered but not the other way The TCP/IP model consists of layers (application, transport, internet, network access) that stack vertically, with each layer handling specific functions (e.g., TCP for reliable data transfer, IP for routing)
                    **Inter-Domain Routing**: Packets traverse multiple networks (e.g., school, Comcast, Google) using routing tables, with inter-domain routing governed by BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for dynamic path selection.. Recall that the router forwarding table entries governing forwarding of packets over the inter-domain link between the Comcast and Google networks are determined by the BGP protocol (Chapter 5).
                    **State Management in TCP**: The three-way handshake and subsequent state transitions (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) ensure that both ends of a connection are synchronized and ready to exchange data.. Bob’s laptop thus first creates a TCP SYN segment with destination port 80 (for HTTP), places the TCP segment inside an IP datagram with a destination IP address of 64.233.169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch. A TCP SYNACK (Section 3.5.6) segment is generated, placed inside a datagram addressed to Bob’s laptop, and finally placed inside a link-layer frame appropriate for the link connecting www.google.com to its first-hop router. The datagram is demultiplexed within the operating system to the TCP socket created in step 18, which enters the connected state.
                    **HTTP Request-Response Cycle**: A client (e.g., browser) sends an HTTP GET request to a server (e.g., Google), which responds with the requested web page content (e.g., HTML) after processing the request.. Bob’s browser creates the HTTP GET message (Section 2.2.3) containing the URL to be fetched. The HTTP GET message is then written into the socket, with the GET message becoming the payload of a TCP segment. The HTTP server at www.google.com reads the HTTP GET message from the TCP socket, creates an HTTP response message (Section 2.2), places the requested Web page content in the body of the HTTP response message, and sends the message into the TCP socket. The datagram containing the HTTP reply message is forwarded through the Google, Comcast, and school networks, and arrives at Bob’s laptop. Bob’s Web browser program reads the HTTP response from the socket, extracts the html for the Web page from the body of the HTTP response, and finally (finally!) displays the Web page! Bob’s browser creates the HTTP GET message (Section 2.2.3) containing the URL to be fetched. The HTTP GET message is then written into the socket, with the GET message becoming the payload of a TCP segment.
                    **ARP/Route Table Interaction**: ARP resolves MAC addresses for local network communication, while routing tables direct packets across networks (e.g., from Bob’s school to Google’s network).. Bob’s laptop creates an ARP query message with a target IP address of 68.85.2.1 (the default gateway), places the ARP message within an Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) and sends the Ethernet frame to the switch, which delivers the frame to all connected devices, including the gateway router. The routers in the school network, Comcast’s network, and Google’s network forward the datagram containing the TCP SYN toward www.google.com, using the forwarding table in each router, as in steps 14–16 above. Recall that the router forwarding table entries governing forwarding of packets over the inter-domain link between the Comcast and Google networks are determined by the BGP protocol (Chapter 5). Bob’s laptop sends this frame to the switch, which delivers the frame to the gateway router
                    **Stateless vs. Stateful Protocols**: DNS and ARP are stateless, while TCP is stateful, maintaining connection states (e.g., SYN, ESTABLISHED) to ensure reliable communication.. Bob’s laptop thus creates a TCP SYN segment with destination port 80 (for HTTP), places the TCP segment inside an IP datagram with a destination IP address of 64.233.169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch.
                    **Role of Gateways**: The default gateway (e.g., 68.85.2.1) acts as a bridge between a local network (e.g., school) and external networks (e.g., the internet), routing traffic based on IP addresses.. Bob’s laptop will send all datagrams with destination address outside of its subnet 68.85.2.0/24 to the default gateway.
                    **DNS Recursive Queries**: A client may use a recursive DNS resolver (e.g., the gateway router’s DNS server) to resolve a domain name, which in turn queries other DNS servers (e.g., root servers, TLD servers) to find the correct IP address.. The operating system on Bob’s laptop thus creates a DNS query message (Section 2.5.3), putting the string “www.google.com” in the question section of the DNS message. This DNS message is then placed within a UDP segment with a destination port of 53 (DNS server). The UDP segment is then placed within an IP datagram with an IP destination address of 68.87.71.226 (the address of the DNS server returned in the DHCP ACK in step 5) and a source IP address of 68.85.2.101.
                    **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: The IP address (e.g., 68.85.2.101) includes a network portion (e.g., 68.85.2.0/24) and host portion, enabling routing decisions and subnet-based communication.. Bob’s laptop then places the datagram containing the DNS query message in an Ethernet frame. This frame will be sent (addressed, at the link layer) to the gateway router in Bob’s school’s network. Bob’s laptop has the IP address of www.google.com, it can create the TCP socket [...] with a destination IP address of 64.233.169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch. the IP address of www.google.com, it can create the TCP socket [...] with a destination IP address of 64.233.169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch. the IP address of www.google.com, it can create the TCP socket [...] with a destination IP address of 64.233.169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch.
                    **Routing Table Entries**: Routers use forwarding tables to determine the next hop for packets, with entries determined by BGP for inter-domain routing and static/dynamic routing protocols for intra-domain traffic.. the router forwarding table entries governing forwarding of packets over the inter-domain link between the Comcast and Google networks are determined by the BGP protocol (Chapter 5)
                    **End-to-End Principle**: Communication is handled by end hosts (e.g., Bob’s laptop and Google’s server) rather than intermediate routers, ensuring reliability and flexibility in network design.. Bob’s laptop thus first creates a TCP SYN segment with destination port 80 (for HTTP), places the TCP segment inside an IP datagram with a destination IP address of 64.233..169.105 (www.google.com), places the datagram inside a frame with a destination MAC address of 00:22:6B:45:1F:1B (the gateway router) and sends the frame to the switch. The TCP SYN message is extracted from the datagram and demultiplexed to the welcome socket associated with port 80. A connection socket (Section 2.7) is created for the TCP connection between the Google HTTP server and Bob’s laptop. The HTTP GET message is then written into the socket, with the GET message becoming the payload of a TCP segment. The TCP segment is placed in a datagram and sent and delivered to www.google.com as in steps 18–20 above. The HTTP server at www.google.com reads the HTTP GET message from the TCP socket, creates an HTTP response message (Section 2.2), places the requested Web page content in the body of the HTTP response message, and sends the message into the TCP socket.
                    IP address ranges 0.0.0.0 through 0.255.255.255 are not part of the normal Class A range and are reserved for special purposes, though nodes using them cannot communicate properly on the Internet.. The address range from 0.0.0.0 through 0.255.255.255 should not be considered part of the normal Class A range. 0.x.x.x addresses serve no particular function in IP, but nodes attempting to use them will be unable to communicate properly on the Internet.
                    The loopback address 127.0.0.1 is used to test network adapters, as messages sent to it are intercepted by the adapter and returned to the application without being sent to the network.. Messages sent to 127.0.0.1 do not get delivered to the network. Instead, the adapter intercepts all loopback messages and returns them to the sending application.
                    Addresses 127.0.0.0 through 127.255.255.255 are reserved for loopback, while 224.0.0.0 through 224.0.0.255 are reserved for routing protocols and multicast-related protocols.. 127.0.0.0 through 127.255.255.255 reserved for loopback The range of addresses between 224.0.0.0 and 224.0.0.255, inclusive, is reserved for the use of routing protocols and other low-level topology discovery or maintenance protocols, such as gateway discovery and group membership reporting.
                    Multicast addresses in the range 224.0.0.0–224.0.0.255 are reserved for routing protocols and low-level topology discovery, and multicast routers should not forward datagrams with destination addresses in this range.. 224-239 are used for multicast (see http://www.firewall.cx/multicast-intro.php, also Google IGMP & PIM)) The range of addresses between 224.0.0.0 and 224.0..255, inclusive, is reserved for the use of routing protocols and other low-level topology discovery or maintenance protocols, such as gateway discovery and group membership reporting. Multicast routers should not forward any multicast datagram with destination addresses in this range, regardless of its TTL.
                    Addresses 255.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255 are reserved for IP broadcast, where packets are sent to all devices on a network.. 255.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255 reserved for IP broadcast
                    The Class C network 192.168.1.0/24 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0) is divided into two /25 subnets: 192.168.1.0/25 (hosts 192.168.1.0–192.168.1.127) and 192.168.1.128/25 (hosts 192.168.1.128–192.168.1.255).. The address range from 0.0.0.0 through 0.255.255.255 should not be considered part of the normal Class A range. 0.x.x.x addresses serve no particular function in IP, but nodes attempting to use them will be unable to communicate properly on the Internet. 192.168.1.0/24    255.255.255.0 (subnet mask) Divided equally into 2 subnets of 128 hosts 192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.127 = 192.168.1.0/25 (hosts 192.168.1.0–192.168.1.127) and 192.168.1.128/25 (hosts 192.168.1.128–192.168.1.255).
                    The /25 subnet mask allows 128 hosts per subnet, with the first host in each subnet being the network address and the last host being the broadcast address.. Divided equally into 2 subnets of 128 hosts

                    Hubs create a single collision domain and broadcast domain for all connected devices, while switches isolate each port into its own collision domain but share a single broadcast domain.. A Hub interconnects devices at layer 1 layer (physical). A collision domain is part of a network where packet collisions can occur. A broadcast domain is a domain in which a broadcast is forwarded. For all hosts connected through a hub, there is one collision domain and one broadcast domain. A Switch interconnects devices primarily at layer 2 layer (data link). Buffering of frames prevents collisions. Each port is isolated and builds its own collision domain. For all hosts connected through a switch, each port is isolated and builds its own collision domain but broadcast domain remains as one.

                    IAM Policies Define Access Control. An IAM policy is a formal statement of permissions that will be granted to an entity. Policies specify what actions are allowed, which resources to allow the actions on, and what the effect will be when the user requests access to the resources. The principle of least privilege is an important concept in computer security. It promotes that you grant only the minimal user privileges needed to the user, based on the needs of your users. Policies can be attached to any IAM entity. Entities include users, groups, roles, or resources. Identity-based policies are permissions policies that you can attach to a principal (or identity) such as an IAM user, role, or group.
                    Role-Based Access for EC2 Instances. The administrator does not need to grant the application developer permission to access the photos bucket, and the developer never needs to share or manage credentials. When the application runs on the instance, it can use the role's temporary credentials to access the photos bucket. To learn more details about this example, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances. The administrator creates the IAM role and attaches the role to the EC2 instance. The role includes a permissions policy that grants read-only access to the specified S3 bucket. It also includes a trust policy that allows the EC2 instance to assume the role and retrieve the temporary credentials.
                    Principle of Least Privilege in IAM.  The principle of least privilege is an important concept in computer security. It promotes that you grant only the minimal user privileges needed to the user, based on the needs of your users. When you create IAM policies, it is a best practice to follow this security advice of granting least privilege. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too broad and then later trying to lock down the permissions granted. All actions in the account are denied to the user by default (implicit deny) unless those actions are explicitly allowed. It effectively grants read-only permissions.
                    "Explicit Deny Overrides Explicit Allow in IAM Policies. When there is a conflict, the most restrictive policy applies. An explicit deny statement takes precedence over an allow statement. The example IAM policy grants users access only to the following resources: ... It also includes an explicit deny (""Effect"":""Deny"") element. The NotResource element helps to ensure that users cannot use any other DynamoDB or S3 actions or resources except the actions and resources that are specified in the policy — even if permissions have been granted in another policy. An explicit deny statement takes precedence over an allow statement."

                    Policy Evaluation Order in IAM. IAM first checks for the existence of any applicable explicit denial policy. If no explicit denial exists, it then checks for any applicable explicit allow policy. If neither an explicit deny nor an explicit allow policy exists, IAM reverts to the default, which is to deny access. The order in which the policies are evaluated has no effect on the outcome of the evaluation. All policies are evaluated, and the result is always that the request is either allowed or denied. When there is a conflict, the most restrictive policy applies.
                    Resource-Based vs. Identity-Based Policies. There are two types of IAM policies. Identity - based policies are permissions policies that you can attach to a principal (or identity) such as an IAM user, role, or group. Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource, such as an S3 bucket. Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource, such as an S3 bucket.

However, you may find that the additional features and security offered by SOAP are enough to sway your decision. In the end, the ""right"" choice between SOAP and REST will be highly dependent on your own situation. SOAP may be better suited for high data integrity requirements. In this case, REST APIs may require additional software modules to enforce the state at the server or database level. Modern applications like mobile apps and hybrid applications work better with REST APIs. REST gives you the scalability and flexibility to design applications using modern architecture patterns like microservices and containers. However, if you need to integrate or extend legacy systems that already have SOAP APIs, you may be better off continuing with SOAP. Public APIs have lower security requirements and demand greater flexibility so anyone can interact with them. So, REST is a better choice when you build public APIs.

                    "Use Elastic Load Balancers to distribute traffic and monitor metrics with CloudWatch"" is a good idea. Then, ""Idea 2: Elastic IPs ensure high availability by replacing failed instances without changing IP addresses"" would be another.. These load balancers send traffic to Amazon EC2 instances, and they can also send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which is a managed monitoring service. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address."
                    Use Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to distribute traffic across Amazon EC2 instances, monitor metrics via Amazon CloudWatch, and trigger Auto Scaling to scale resources based on demand.. The foundation of the web tier includes the use of Elastic load balancers in the architecture. These load balancers send traffic to Amazon EC2 instances, and they can also send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which is a managed monitoring service. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet.
                    Elastic IPs enable high availability by allowing replacement of failed EC2 instances without changing the IP address, ensuring consistent connectivity for applications.. An Elastic IP address is an IP address that can be assigned to any Amazon EC2 instance. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address. The diagram shows two separate clients: desktop and mobile. The clients are connecting to an application server. If that application server goes down, you can launch a new Amazon EC2 instance and assign the same Elastic IP address to it. This enables you to survive a server failure and not have to rewrite any code. Elastic IP addresses are very important because they allow us to mask the failure of an instance or software by allowing users and clients to use the same IP address with replacement resources.
                    Route 53 provides high availability through DNS failover, health checks, and routing policies (e.g., weighted round robin, latency-based, geolocation) to direct traffic to optimal endpoints.. Route 53 lets you track the health status of your resources and take action when an error occurs. It is straightforward to configure failover with Amazon Route 53. Route 53 supports simple routing in a single server environment, and it supports weighted round robin, which assigns the weights according to the desired access frequency. Route 53 also supports latency-based routing, which provides the fastest connection to the application. Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, or the origin of DNS queries. With DNS failover, Amazon Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack.
                    "DNS failover with Route 53 automatically redirects traffic to a static backup (e.g., Amazon S3) if the primary server (e.g., ELB or EC2) becomes unreachable, ensuring application continuity.. First, create two DNS records for the CNAME www with a routing policy of Failover Routing. The first record is the primary, and it points to the ELB load balancer for your web application. The second record is the ""Secondary"" route policy, and it points to your static Amazon S3 website. If something happened to the primary link, traffic would automatically be redirected to the static website that's hosted in the Amazon S3 bucket. With DNS failover routing, Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack."
                    Route 53 health checks verify the availability of endpoints (e.g., web servers, databases) by checking for specific strings in response content or other metrics, enabling dynamic failover decisions.. Note that for string matching, the health check looks for a particular string in the page body, within the first 5 KB of content. You could use string matching to confirm whether the DB instance is working by matching on a string that the page would contain only if it successfully connects to the DB. Route 53 health-checking agents will monitor each location or endpoint of your application to determine its availability. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack.
                    Multivalue answer routing in Route 53 returns multiple health-checkable IP addresses, improving availability and load balancing by distributing traffic across multiple resources.. Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Route 53 to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses so you can use DNS to improve availability and load balancing. With multiple answers, if you want to route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, you can create one multivalue answer record for each resource and, optionally, associate an Amazon Route 53 health check with each record.
                    Geolocation and geoproximity routing in Route 53 allow location-based traffic management, such as regional content delivery or biasing traffic toward closer AWS regions.. Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, or the origin of DNS queries. Geoproximity routing lets you route traffic based on the physical distance between your users and your resources if you're using Route 53 traffic flow. You can also route more or less traffic to each resource by specifying a positive or negative bias.
                    Weighted round robin in Route 53 enables A/B testing by assigning traffic proportions to different endpoints based on specified weights (e.g., 75% to a new server, 25% to an old one).. Weighted round robin allows you to assign weights to resource record sets in order to specify the frequency with which different responses are served. You might want to use this capability to do A/B testing, where you send a small portion of traffic to a server where you made a software change.
                    High availability requires redundancy, failure detection, and failover mechanisms across all components (e.g., databases, servers, networks) to ensure continuous operation during outages.. Route 53 lets you track the health status of your resources and take action when an error occurs. It is straightforward to configure failover with Amazon Route 53. With DNS failover routing, Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack. Route 53 supports health checks and DNS failover if the primary site becomes unreachable.
                    Elastic IP addresses and Auto Scaling work together to maintain application availability by replacing failed instances with new ones while preserving the same IP address for clients.. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address. if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet. The diagram shows two separate clients: desktop and mobile. The clients are connecting to an application server. If that application server goes down, you can launch a new Amazon EC2 instance and assign the same Elastic IP address to it. This enables you to survive a server failure and not have to rewrite any code.
                    Route 53 supports latency-based routing, directing users to the AWS endpoint (e.g., ELB, EC2) with the fastest performance, improving global application responsiveness.. Route 53 supports latency-based routing (or LBR) helps you improve your application’s performance for a global audience. LBR works by routing your customers to the AWS endpoint (for example Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic IP addresses or load balancers) that provides the fastest experience based on actual performance measurements of the different AWS Regions where your application is running.
                    Health checks in Route 53 can validate specific strings in response content (e.g., a database connection success message) to confirm the operational status of critical backend services.. Note that for string matching, the health check looks for a particular string in the page body, within the first 5 KB of content. You could use string matching to confirm whether the DB instance is working by matching on a string that the page would contain only if it successfully connects to the DB.
                    Auto Scaling integrates with ELB and CloudWatch to dynamically adjust server capacity based on traffic patterns, ensuring resources scale up or down to meet demand.. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet.
                    High availability design principles include replication of data and infrastructure, redundancy of components, and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure resilience.. For each component -> if critical -> implement redundancy, detect failure and failover and design for replication. Route 53 lets you track the health status of your resources and take action when an error occurs. It is straightforward to configure failover with Amazon Route 53. Route 53 supports failover routing, which redirects traffic to alternate locations if the primary site is down. With DNS failover routing, Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. The foundation of the web tier includes the use of Elastic load balancers in the architecture. These load balancers send traffic to Amazon EC2 instances, and they can also send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which is a managed monitoring service. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet. Elastic load balancers will distribute traffic within a Region. If you want to go outside a Region, you have to use Amazon Route 53. The service is called Route 53 because DNS servers respond to queries on the User Datagram Protocol—or UDP—port 53. Route 53 is one of our only services that has a 100% availability service-level agreement.
                    Route 53 traffic flow policies enable complex routing strategies, such as combining multiple endpoints (e.g., regional servers) with weighted or latency-based prioritization for optimized user experience.. Route 53 supports weighted round robin, which assigns the weights according to the desired access frequency. Route 53 also supports latency-based routing, which provides the fastest connection to the application based on actual performance measurements of the different AWS Regions where your application is running. Geoproximity routing lets you route traffic based on the physical distance between your users and your resources if you're using Route 53 traffic flow. You can also route more or less traffic to each resource by specifying a positive or negative bias. With multiple answers, if you want to route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, you can create one multivalue answer record for each resource and, optionally, associate an Amazon Route 53 health check with each record.

                    Week 6:
                    Auto Scaling in AWS dynamically adjusts the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group based on metrics like CPU usage, ensuring resources align with workload demand.. Auto Scaling scales the assigned Auto Scaling group out and adds another instance. When the CPU use becomes greater than 60%, the desired capacity becomes four, or 2x2. If the CPU use is between 60%-80%, the desired capacity of the group increases by 1 instance to 11 instances. When the usage spike subsides and average CPU use drops to 20%-40%, the desired capacity of the group decreases by 1 instance to 11 instances. If the CPU use continues to rise and becomes to more than 80%, the second step adjustments would be triggered, and an additional server would be launched.
                    CloudWatch alarms monitor metrics (e.g., latency, CPU usage) and trigger Auto Scaling policies to scale out (add instances) or scale in (remove instances) when thresholds are breached.. • In this scenario, a CloudWatch alarm is assigned to the load balancer that keeps track of latency. When it is triggered, the alarm notifies Amazon CloudWatch. This triggers CloudWatch to execute an Auto Scaling policy. When you create a step scaling policy, you add one or more step adjustments that enable you to scale resources based on the size of the alarm breach. Auto Scaling scales the assigned Auto Scaling group out and adds another instance.
                    Step scaling policies define ranges for metrics (e.g., CPU usage between 60%-80%) and specify scaling adjustments (e.g., adding 1 instance) for each range, avoiding overlapping or gaps in thresholds..  When you create a step scaling policy, you add one or more step adjustments that enable you to scale resources based on the size of the alarm breach. Each step adjustment specifies a lower bound for the metric value, an upper bound for the metric value, and the amount by which to scale, based on the scaling adjustment type. The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap. If the CPU use is between 60%-80%, the desired capacity of the group increases by 1 instance to 11 instances. This change is based on the second step adjustment of the scale-out policy, which will add 1 instance when the average CPU use is between 60%-80%.
                    Warm-up periods are required for newly launched instances to ensure they are fully operational before contributing to aggregated metrics, preventing premature scaling decisions.. The new instance is launched, but not added, to the aggregated group metrics until after a warm-up period expires. While scaling out, we do not consider instances that are warming up as part of the current capacity of the group. Therefore, multiple alarm breaches that fall in the range of the same step adjustment result in a single scaling activity. After entering the warmup period from the second step adjustment, the second instance is added to the Auto Scaling group.
                    Minimum capacity in an Auto Scaling group is the lowest number of instances that can run, while desired capacity is the default number, and maximum capacity is a hard limit on scaling.. The desired capacity is different from the minimum capacity. The desired capacity of an Auto Scaling group is the default number of instances that should be running. The minimum capacity of a group is the fewest number of instances the group can have running. Set the minimum and maximum capacity parameter values carefully. The desired capacity is different from the minimum capacity. The next time the alarm gets triggered, you can no longer double the current group capacity because the maximum capacity is set to 12.
                    Scaling in should be done slowly to avoid workload spikes that could cause thrashing, while scaling out should be done quickly to handle sudden traffic increases.. Be sure to scale back very slowly, because you do not want to create something that causes CPU thrashing. It would be possible to set up a step adjustment to scale in more aggressively if the load continues to drop. Just remember that it is better to scale up quickly and scale down slowly. If you terminate an instance too quickly, another spike might take place and cause more servers to be created. scaling out early, and scale in slowly, rather than aggressively.
                    Lifecycle hooks allow custom actions (e.g., data cleanup) to be executed when instances are launched or terminated, ensuring smooth application of scaling events.. Use lifecycle hooks to perform custom actions when Auto Scaling launches or terminates instances. An example of a lifecycle hook would be when someone uploads something to your Amazon S3 bucket.
                    Stateful applications require careful configuration of Auto Scaling groups, as instances may need time to stabilize and become fully usable after launch.. Stateful applications require additional automatic configuration of instances that are launched into Auto Scaling groups. Remember that instances can take several minutes after launch before they are fully usable.
                    Auto Scaling interacts with Elastic Load Balancing to manage instance termination, using connection draining to ensure active connections are closed before an instance is removed.. Elastic Load Balancing has a feature called connection draining. This feature is a period of time when Elastic Load Balancing stops sending requests to the instance that was identified for termination prior to deregistering it . After the time has elapsed, Elastic Load Balancing will forcefully close all open connections and terminate the targeted instance.
                    "Maximum capacity is determined by application needs, budgets, or infrastructure constraints, balancing resource efficiency with system stability.. Selecting a reasonable maximum capacity size depends on your application and possibly a budget. You pay for what you use; therefore, your organization might limit you from running more than a certain number of instances. Even if you don’t have a budget restriction, there is no single answer. Be sure to scale back very slowly, because you do not want to create something that causes CPU thrashing."
                    Step adjustments in scaling policies must adhere to strict rules (e.g., no overlapping ranges, one null bound per direction) to ensure predictable and reliable scaling behavior..  There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your policy: • The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap. • Only one step adjustment can have a null lower bound, or negative infinity. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound. • Only one step adjustment can have a null upper bound, or positive infinity. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound. • The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.
                    "Scaling policies avoid cooldown periods, but step adjustments can be configured to scale in more aggressively when load drops, though this must be balanced with potential spikes.. Auto Scaling step adjustments do not support the use of ""cooldown periods"". It would be possible to set up a step adjustment to scale in more aggressively if the load continues to drop. Be sure to scale back very slowly, because you do not want to create something that causes CPU thrashing. Scaling in means that you decrease the computing capacity due to low use."
                    Minimum capacity should consider instance launch times (minutes) and workload unpredictability, avoiding zero minimum for applications with sporadic demand.. Deciding on the minimum capacity size depends on the type of applications that you run. Here are some things to consider: If you are processing batches that run once a week, you might want to set the minimum to zero. Remember that it takes minutes to launch a new instance, depending on the complexity of your launch configuration. You might not be able to afford zero minimum capacity to start with. Remember that it takes minutes to launch a new instance, depending on the complexity of your launch configuration. You might not be able to afford zero minimum capacity to start with.
                    Auto Scaling groups aim to maintain desired capacity, but warm-up periods and instance readiness can temporarily delay changes in aggregated metrics.. The new instance is launched, but not added, to the aggregated group metrics until after a warm-up period expires. While scaling out, we do not consider instances that are warming up as part of the current capacity of the group. After entering the warmup period from the second step adjustment, the second instance is added to the Auto Scaling group.
                    The relationship between minimum capacity and Availability Zones ensures high availability, with at least one instance per zone for redundancy.. If you require at least one instance per Availability Zone to start with, the minimum capacity size should be set to the number of Availability Zones. The case on this slide requires a minimum of two instances across two separate Availability Zones, so the desired capacity is two.
                    Step scaling policies can scale out incrementally (e.g., +1 instance for CPU 60%-80%) and scale in progressively (e.g., -1 instance for CPU 20%-40%) to stabilize workload..  If the CPU use is between 60%-80%, the desired capacity of the group increases by 1 instance to 11 instances. When the usage spike subsides and average CPU use drops to 20%-40%, the desired capacity of the group decreases by 1 instance to 11 instances. This change is based on the third step adjustment of the policy, which removes 1 instance when the average CPU use is 20%-40%.
                    Auto Scaling balances cost efficiency and system stability by dynamically adjusting resources, avoiding over-provisioning while ensuring capacity to handle traffic spikes.. You pay for what you use, so you don’t need to launch more instances than you need, and your resources can automatically scale based on demand. Auto Scaling balances cost efficiency and system stability by dynamically adjusting resources, avoiding over-provisioning while ensuring capacity to handle traffic spikes. Be sure to scale back very slowly, because you do not want to create something that causes CPU thrashing.

                    Week 9:
                    Parameters in AWS CloudFormation define input values for templates, with optional default values, descriptions, and user-facing visibility in the AWS Console.. The only required attribute is Type, which can be String, Number, or CommaDelimitedList. You can also add a Description attribute that tells a user more about what kind of value they should specify. The parameter's name and description appear in the Specify Parameters page when a user uses the template in the Create Stack wizard. In this example, the InstanceTypeParameter specifies a default Amazon EC2 instance type of t2.micro, but users can choose from a t2.micro, m1.small, or m1.large instance type when they invoke the template. It also provides a description, which appears in the AWS CloudFormation Console when the template is launched.
                    Mappings provide conditional values for resources (e.g., AMI IDs based on AWS regions), enabling dynamic template behavior without code changes.. Mappings allow you to customize the properties of a resource based on certain conditions, which enables you to have fine-grained control over how your templates are launched. For example, an AMI ImageId number is unique to a Region, and the person who received your template might not necessarily know which AMI to use. You can thus provide the AMI lookup list using the Mappings parameter. This example contains a map for Regions. The mapping lists the AMI that should be used, based on the Region that the EC2 instance will launch in.
                    "Conditions allow templates to create or configure resources based on input parameters (e.g., environment type: dev, qa, prod), enabling environment-specific configurations.. You might use conditions when you want to reuse a template that can create resources in different contexts, such as a test environment versus a production environment. In your template, you can add an EnvironmentType input parameter, which accepts either “prod” or “test” as inputs. For the production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain capabilities; however, for the test environment, you want to use reduced capabilities to save money. With conditions, you can define which resources are created, and how they're configured for each environment type. When the previous template is applied to this example, only one set of resources in one Availability Zone is launched when the target environment is development, or DEV. When this template is used in production--or PROD—the solution launches two sets of resources in two different Availability Zones. So, without making a single change, you can get a redundant environment from the same template. In this example, the EnvType parameter specifies whether you want to create a Dev environment, a QA—environment, or a Prod environment. Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, such as which database it points to. You can use “Condition” to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment."
                    "The Resources section declares AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets) in a template, with multiple resources of the same type allowed and separated by commas.. The Resources section is required, and it declares the AWS resources that will be included or created in the stack, such as an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon Simple Storage Service –or Amazon S3—bucket. You must declare each resource separately; however, you can specify multiple resources of the same type. If you declare multiple resources, separate them with commas."
                    The DependsOn attribute ensures CloudFormation waits for one resource to be created before launching another (e.g., a database must be created before an EC2 instance).. The DependsOn attribute is an important attribute. DependsOn is how you specify that AWS CloudFormation should wait to launch a resource until a specific, different resource has already finished being created. In this case, there is an Amazon EC2 instance that can only be created after the database has been established. So, the creation of the Amazon EC2 instance depends on when the database is created.
                    Outputs capture values from a stack (e.g., DNS names, IP addresses) for post-deployment use, providing feedback on successful stack execution.. Outputs can specify the string output of any logical identifier that is available in the template. It's a convenient way to capture important information about your resources or input parameters. Outputs are values that are returned whenever you view the properties of your stack.
                    Templates should group related resources (e.g., VPCs, subnets, route tables) into separate templates for network, security, and application components.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles.
                    Network, security, and application resources should be isolated into distinct templates to enforce separation of concerns and reduce risk.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates. You don’t want to have too many things inside of one template across numerous applications. If you have an application template that supports only one application, changes to the template only affect that one application. If you have an application template that supports several applications, changes to the template will affect several applications, and the changes can cause all of the applications to be retested. we do not recommend sharing templates across management teams because different needs and standards can impact teams inappropriately Here's an example of how stack can be grouped with AWS CloudFormation groups. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles.
                    Avoid sharing templates across teams or applications unless centralizing control over specific resource types (e.g., IAM policies).. Avoid sharing a single template across applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type. we do not recommend sharing templates across management teams because different needs and standards can impact teams inappropriately
                    Security-focused templates should be stored in separate repositories to maintain isolation and reduce exposure.. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates.
                    Templates can be organized into categories (e.g., front-end, backend, shared services, base network, identity) to structure infrastructure logically.. Here's an example of how stack can be grouped with AWS CloudFormation groups. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles. A good guideline is to organize the resources like they are software. Think about the tightly connected components to your infrastructure, and put them in the same templates. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates.
                    "Production environments may require redundant resources (e.g., multiple Availability Zones) via conditional logic, while test environments use simplified configurations.. When the previous template is applied to this example, only one set of resources in one Availability Zone is launched when the target environment is development, or DEV. When this template is used in production--or PROD—the solution launches two sets of resources in two different Availability Zones. Your production environment and development environment must have the same stack in order to ensure that your application works the way that it was designed. Your DEV environment and QA environment must have the same stack of applications and the same configuration. The process of creating those environments manually can be error-prone. You can use a Conditions statement in the template to solve this problem. In this example, the EnvType parameter specifies whether you want to create a Dev environment, a QA—environment, or a Prod environment. Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, such as which database it points to. You can use ""Condition"" to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment."
                    Template grouping follows software-like principles, bundling tightly connected infrastructure components (e.g., a VPC template includes subnets, gateways, and ACLs).. Here's an example of how stack can be grouped with AWS CloudFormation groups. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles. A network resource template named “NetworkSharedTierVpcIgwNat.template” might include definitions for the following resources: VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, route tables, and network access control lists, or ACLs. A good guideline is to organize the resources like they are software. Think about the tightly connected components to your infrastructure, and put them in the same templates.
                    Templates should avoid being reused across multiple applications unless intentionally centralized, to prevent unintended side effects across projects.. While templates can be reused to create multiple environments or parts of environments, we do not recommend building all of an application's within one template. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Avoid sharing a single template across applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type.

If you have an application template that supports only one application, changes to the template only affect that one application. If you have an application template that supports several applications, changes to the template will affect several applications, and the changes can cause all of the applications to be retested. For this reason, we do not recommend using a single template across multiple applications.

                    Templates for shared services (e.g., monitoring, logging) should be decoupled from application-specific templates to ensure consistency and reusability.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates.

Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, suchity which database it points to. You can use “Condition” to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment Conditions are evaluated based on input parameter values that you specify when you create or update a stack.

                    Week 10:
                    **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. Single Responsibility Principle. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product. The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it's easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.
                    **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**. Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code. Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
                    **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**. now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the deliver method, but exactly how it works isn't important to the client.
                    **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**. The client code doesn’t see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code. The framework (high-level) depends on the abstraction (factory method) rather than concrete classes. The client code treats all the products as abstract Transport.
                    **Collaboration Between Coders**. There are two coders involved (potentially between vendors or teams), what is the implications of this design? The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. Imagine that you write an app using an open source UI framework. Your app should have round buttons, but the framework only provides square ones. You extend the standard Button class with a glorious RoundButton subclass. But now you need to tell the main UIFramework class to use the new button subclass instead of a default one.
                    **Avoiding Tight Coupling**. You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products. The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.
                    **Reusability Across Teams**. Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with. The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code. Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components. Imagine that you write an app using an open source UI framework. Your app should have round buttons, but the framework only provides square ones. You extend the standard Button class with a glorious RoundButton subclass. But now you need to tell the main UIFramework class to use the new button subclass instead of a default one. The Factory Method allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
                    **Handling Multiple Coders in Complex Systems**. There are two coders involved (potentially between vendors or teams), what is the implications of this design? Inheritance is probably the easiest way to extend the default behavior of a library or framework. But how would the framework recognize that your subclass should be used instead of a standard component? you create a subclass UIWithRoundButtons from a base framework class and override its createButton method. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.
                    **SOLID Principles in Practice**. Single Responsibility Principle. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product. You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products. Use the Factory Method when you don't know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code. The director class completely hides the details of product construction from the client code.
                    **Single Responsibility Principle**. Single Responsibility Principle: This principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change. This principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
                    **Open-Closed Principle**. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application. To extend the feature of adding a tag to a post message, Left - a new class is extended with a new createPost method. Right – an if else statement is written within the createPost method.
                    "**Liskov Substitution Principle**. if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program. Square does not comply with the behavior of a rectangle: Changing the height/width of a square behaves differently from changing the height/width of a rectangle. Rectangle rect = new Square(); // Let’s say this object is passed to another developer with the impression it’s a rectangle class.
                    rect.setWidth(5);
                    rect.setHeight(9);
                    System.out.println(""The area is "" + rect.getArea());   // confused as expected area is 5*9=45 but the output is 81."
                    **Interface Segregation Principle**. Interface segregation. It simply means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.
                    **Dependency Inversion Principle**. Dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions. Left – FileLogger object is instantiated within the customer object Right – FileLogger object is injected into the customer object
                    **Technical Debt**. Technical debt (also known as design debt[1] or code debt, but can be also related to other technical endeavors) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.[2] *These points are also applicable at the systems level. * Beware of Technical Debts!
                    **Encapsulation & Gateway Façade**. Example – you have a set of objects that implement a feature. You might want your callers to invoke this feature only through one or few objects in this set to encapsulate the rest of the objects. (encapsulation, gateway façade)
                    **Singleton Pattern**. Example – you might want your object to be instantiated only once to save memory. (consistency, singleton)
                    **Extending Behavior with Inheritance**. To extend the post feature with adding a tag to a post message, Left - a new class is extended with a new createPost method Right – an if else statement is written within the createPost method For left, it extend but also modify the behavior that both setHeight and setWidth are the same. Square does not comply with the behavior of a rectangle: Changing the height/width of a square behaves differently from changing the height/width of a rectangle.
                    **Avoiding Code Duplication**. Left – FileLogger object is instantiated within the customer object Right – FileLogger object is injected into the customer object To extend feature of adding a tag post, Left - a new class is extended with a new createPost method Right – an if else statement is written within the createPost method Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application. larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones.

                    **Interface-Based Design**. Interface segregation. It simply means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them. To design interfaces for creating new post and reading existing posts features. Caller can create or read posts or both. Left – create an interface with create and another with create and read. Right – create an interface with create and another with read. Example – you have a set of objects that implement a feature. You might want to allow your callers to invoke this feature only through one or few objects in this set to encapsulate the rest of the objects. (encapsulation, gateway façade)
                    **Modular Design**. Design your components to be modular and reusable so that it is analyzed, modified and tested a class should have one, and only one, reason to change. Depend on abstractions not on concrete implementations. Encapsulation, gateway façade Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. If class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program. The Square does not comply with the behavior of a rectangle: Changing the height/width of a square behaves differently from changing the height/width of a rectangle.

                    **Decoupling with Dependency Injection**. Dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions. Left – FileLogger object is instantiated within the customer object Right – FileLogger object is injected into the customer object If you need to modify the behaviour, will their code needs to change? (decoupling, interfaces, factory, subclass)
                    "**Behavioral Consistency**. if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program. Square does not comply with the behavior of a rectangle: Changing the height/width of a square behaves differently from changing the height/width of a rectangle. Rectangle rect = new Square(); // Let’s say this object is passed to another developer with the impression it’s a rectangle class. rect.setWidth(5); rect.setHeight(9); System.out.println(""The area is "" + rect.getArea()); // confused as expected area is 5*9=45 but the output is 81."
                    **Refactoring for Clarity**. Example – you have a set of objects that implement a feature. You might want your callers to invoke this feature only through one or few objects in this set to encapsulate the rest of the objects. (encapsulation, gateway façade) Example - there are other callers that instantiate your classes (do a new) and invoke the methods. If you need to modify the behaviour, will their code needs to change? (decoupling, interfaces, factory, subclass) Example – you might want your object to be instantiated only once to save memory. (consistency, singleton) Testing – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases. Of course, the one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.

Analyzability: ... assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change... Modifiability: ... modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality... Technical Debts! (also known as design debt...) Testing – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases. Lower coupling – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.

                    Week 11:
                    **Observer Pattern** – A design pattern where objects (observers) register themselves with a subject (publisher) to receive notifications when the subject's state changes. The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them when relevant events occur, enabling decoupled communication between objects.. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. Whenever an important event happens to the publisher, it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects. All subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. The publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification. The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher.
                    **Publisher-Subscriber Model** – The subject (publisher) broadcasts events to all registered subscribers (observers), allowing dynamic updates without hardcoding dependencies. This is ideal for systems like real-time data feeds or event-driven architectures.. The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. The subscription mechanism consists of 1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects and 2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list. All subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface.
                    **Subscriber Interface** – Subscribers must implement a common interface to handle notifications from the publisher. This ensures the publisher interacts with all subscribers via a standardized method, reducing coupling to specific subscriber classes.. all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification. subscribers must implement a common interface to handle notifications from the publisher. This ensures the publisher interacts with all subscribers via a standardized method, reducing coupling to specific subscriber classes.
                    **Dynamic Subscription** – Subscribers can join or leave the notification list at runtime, enabling flexibility in managing who receives updates. This is critical for systems like user preference systems or event listeners.. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to. You can establish relations between objects at runtime.
                    **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** – A behavioral pattern where requests are passed sequentially through a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain, enabling dynamic routing of tasks.. Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand. The pattern lets you link several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, 'ask' each handler whether it can process it. This way all handlers get a chance to process the request. Use the pattern when it's essential to execute several handlers in a particular order. You can control the order of request handling.
                    **Handler Decoupling** – Handlers in the Chain of Responsibility are standalone objects with a single responsibility (e.g., authentication, validation). This adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and allows reuse across different contexts.. each check should be extracted to its own class with a single method that performs the check. each handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. all handler classes implement the same interface... without coupling your code to their concrete classes.
                    **Request Flow Control** – Handlers can reject a request and stop further processing, ensuring that only relevant handlers act on the request. This prevents unnecessary work and improves efficiency..  a handler can decide not to pass the request further down the chain and effectively stop any further processing.  a handler decides whether it can process it. If it can, it doesn’t pass the request any further.
                    **Runtime Chain Composition** – Handlers can be dynamically linked or reordered at runtime, enabling flexible workflows. For example, an online ordering system might adjust security checks based on user roles.. Use the pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime. If you provide setters for a reference field inside the handler classes, you’ll be able to insert, remove or reorder handlers dynamically.
                    **Singleton Pattern (SoundPlayer Example)** – A singleton ensures a single instance of a class (e.g., SoundPlayer) for shared resources, preventing multiple instances from interfering. This is useful for system-level services like audio playback or database connections.. other singletons: consider SoundPlayer object
                    **Open/Closed Principle** – Both patterns align with this principle: new observers or handlers can be added without modifying existing code, allowing evolution of systems without breaking existing functionality.. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface). You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing client code.
                    **Event-Driven Architecture** – The Observer pattern is a core component of event-driven systems, where events (state changes) trigger actions in subscribed objects, enabling asynchronous communication.. Subscribers are notified in random order. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. Publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. The Observer pattern is a core component of event-driven systems, where events (state changes) trigger actions in subscribed objects, enabling asynchronous communication.
                    **GUI Event Propagation** – In GUIs, events propagate through a chain of objects (e.g., button → container → window), with the first handler capable of processing the event. This mirrors the Chain of Responsibility pattern.. For instance, when a user clicks a button, the event propagates through the chain of GUI elements that starts with the button, goes along its containers (like forms or panels), and ends up with the main application window. The event is processed by the first element in the chain that's capable of handling it. This example is also noteworthy because it shows that a chain can always be extracted from an object tree. The pattern lets you link several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, 'ask' each handler whether it can process it.
                    **State-Dependent Notifications** – Observers in the Observer pattern react to specific state changes in the subject, ensuring notifications are relevant to the observer’s needs (e.g., inventory updates for a customer).. Subscriber objects are notified when the publisher's state changes, ensuring notifications are relevant to their needs. The publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. Subscribers are notified in random order.
                    **Decoupling in Observer Pattern** – The publisher and subscribers are loosely coupled: the publisher doesn’t need to know the subscriber’s implementation, only that it conforms to the interface. This enhances modularity.. all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface you wouldn’t want to couple the publisher to all of those classes. Besides, you might not even know about some of them beforehand if your publisher class is supposed to be used by other people all subscribers implement the same interface
                    **Dynamic Handler Chains** – The Chain of Responsibility allows handlers to be inserted, removed, or reordered at runtime, making it adaptable to changing requirements or workflows (e.g., security checks in an API).. Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand. The pattern lets you link several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, 'ask' each handler whether it can process it. This way all handlers get a chance to process the request. Use the pattern when it's essential to execute several handlers in a particular order. Since you can link the handlers in the chain in any order, all requests will get through the chain exactly as you planned. Use the CoR pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime. If you provide setters for a reference field inside the handler classes, you'll be able to insert, remove or reorder handlers dynamically.
                    **Conflict Resolution in Patterns** – The Observer and Chain of Responsibility patterns address different challenges: the former handles state changes, the latter handles request routing, but both aim to reduce coupling and improve flexibility.. Either the customer wastes time checking product availability or the store wastes resources notifying the wrong customers. Subscribers are notified in random order. The code of the checks, which had already looked like a mess, became more and more bloated as you added each new feature. Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
                    **Singleton vs. Observer** – While singletons ensure a single instance, the Observer pattern enables multiple observers to react to a single subject. They are distinct but can coexist (e.g., a singleton publisher with multiple observers).. The object that has some interesting state is often called subject, but since it's also going to notify other objects about the changes to its state, we'll call it publisher. All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher's state are called subscribers. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to. e.g., a singleton publisher with multiple observers. Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface).
                    **Event Aggregation** – In complex systems, the Observer pattern can aggregate events (e.g., user actions, system logs) and distribute them to relevant subscribers, centralizing event management.. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. The publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. You can add the subscription mechanism to your buttons, letting the clients hook up their custom code via custom subscriber classes. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to.
                    **Error Handling in Chains** – The Chain of Responsibility allows handlers to handle errors (e.g., invalid input) and propagate them, ensuring robustness without requiring each handler to handle all possible failure scenarios.. Each linked handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. In addition to processing a request, handlers pass the request further along the chain. The request travels along the chain until all handlers have had a chance to process it.
                    **Adapter Pattern Intent** – Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, enabling incompatible classes to collaborate.. Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. ‘…convert the interface of a class into another interface …’ Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
                    **Adapter Implementation** – Uses object composition: an adapter class wraps an adaptee (existing class) and implements a target interface to bridge interface mismatches.. An object adapter relies on object composition: Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee
                    "**Adapter Example** – SAPService (send(Claim claim)) and CSystemAdapter (send(claim) via XML-to-JSON conversion) demonstrate interface translation between incompatible systems.. public class SAPService { public void send(Claim claim) { // some preocessing } } public class CSystemAdapter implements ClaimAdapterInterface { CSystemService nativeObject = new CSystemService(); public void send(Claim claim) { // send claims to C System nativeObject.send(claim.getItems(), claim.amount); } } An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate methods of a wrapped analytics object."
                    **Adapter Applicability** – Reuse legacy/3rd-party classes with incompatible interfaces, or dynamically add functionality to subclasses via adapters.. Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code. Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. You can’t use the analytics library “as is” because it expects the data in a format that’s incompatible with your app. An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.
                    "**Adapter Pros/Cons** – Simplifies interface translation but increases code complexity; adheres to Single Responsibility Principle but risks creating ""god objects"" if overused.. Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program. The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes it’s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code."
                    **Facade Pattern Intent** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, reducing dependencies and coupling between clients and subsystems.. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades.
                    **Facade Example** – Video conversion library facade (encode(filename, format)) hides complexity of underlying video/audio layers, offering a single method for clients.. Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality. For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format). After creating such a class and connecting it with the video conversion library, you’ll have your first facade. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.
                    **Facade Applicability** – Simplify access to complex subsystems, decouple clients from implementation details, or structure subsystems into layers with facades as entry points.. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability. Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem.
                    **Facade vs. Decorator** – Both simplify interfaces, but Facade focuses on external subsystems, while Decorator adds behavior to objects dynamically.. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. This approach looks very similar to the Decorator pattern.
                    **Facade vs. Mediator** – Both reduce coupling, but Facade abstracts subsystems, while Mediator coordinates interactions between multiple objects.. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades. For example, let’s return to our video conversion framework. It can be broken down into two layers: video- and audio-related. For each layer, you can create a facade and then make the classes of each layer communicate with each other via those facades. This approach looks very similar to the Mediator pattern.
                    "**Adapter vs. Facade Comparison** – Adapter bridges interface mismatches, while Facade simplifies access to a complex subsystem; both align with SOLID principles but serve different use cases.. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Adapter Implementation: ""…convert the interface of a class into another interface …"" Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. Facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.

Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem."
                    "**Adapter Example in Claims System** – CSystemAdapter translates XML data to JSON for the analytics library, enabling the stock market app to work with external systems.. Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee. Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee. public class CSystemAdapter implements ClaimAdapterInterface { CSystemService nativeObject = new CSystemService(); public void send(Claim claim) { // send claims to C System nativeObject.send(claim.getItems(), claim.amount); } }"
                    **Facade in Compiler Subsystem** – A facade shields clients from scanner, parser, and code generator classes, offering a unified interface to the compiler’s complex functionality.. Example: In a compiler subsystem, the compiler façade shields the client from the scanner, parser, stream, abstract tree and code generator classes Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.
                    "**Facade Pros/Cons** – Isolates code from subsystem complexity but risks becoming a ""god object"" if it accumulates too many responsibilities.. you can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app"
                    **Adapter and Facade in Practice** – Adapters handle data format conversion (e.g., XML→JSON), while facades abstract subsystems (e.g., video conversion library) for client simplicity.. You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it. An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.
                    **Adapter and Facade in SOLID Context** – Both patterns support Open/Closed Principle (add new adapters/facades without breaking existing code) and Single Responsibility Principle (separate interface logic from business logic).. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface. Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program. You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem. Facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.
                    **Adapter and Facade Use Cases** – Adapters for legacy system integration, facades for simplifying complex libraries (e.g., databases, frameworks).. Problem: Imagine you need to integrate an external codes (e.g. third party) to your existing codes. However, you realize the interfaces are not compatible and you cannot change the external codes. You start to do conditionals but it start to get messy with more external codes that are incompatible. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee. Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee. For example, the SAPService is using send(Claim claim) but the NativeObject is using send(claim.items(), claim.amount) Adapter Implementation Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework. Ordinarily, you’d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on. Facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format). Example: In a compiler subsystem, the compiler façade shields the client from the scanner, parser, stream, abstract tree and code generator classes
                    **Adapter and Facade Tradeoffs** – Adapters require precise interface mapping, while facades may over-simplify subsystems, leading to loss of functionality or flexibility.. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee. Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee. A facade may provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. Facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
                    "**Adapter and Facade in Real-World Scenarios** – Adapter: converting API data formats; Facade: wrapping a database layer to provide simple CRUD operations for clients.. You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it. The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects. Facade is a class that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality."
