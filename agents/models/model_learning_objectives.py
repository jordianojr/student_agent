                    There are many other types of diagrams!!

                    Requirements include:
                    Features to be delivered, constraints on technologies to be used, quality attributes 
                    Good designs meet not just functional requirements but also achieves the qualities and works within the constraints. Focus on the architectural significant requirements.

                    Each of the integration pattern differs in it's purpose, benefits and pitfalls to avoid. We covered file transfer, shared database, database replication, interface integration, messaging, SOAP and RESTful web services, broker and API gateway
                    To decide on which integration method to use in an architecture, one has to consider the environment/context and possible constraints of the method. Some considerations include:
                    Decentralized vs Centralized
                    Batch vs Transaction/record
                    Asynchronous vs Synchronous
                    SQL vs NoSQL
                    Message Sequencing 
                    One-way vs Two-way Replication
                    Point to Point vs Publish Subscribe
                    Polling vs Event Driven Consumers
                    Selectivity, Browsing vs Getting messages
                    Durable vs Non-Durable
                    Persistent vs Non-Persistent
                    Integration Adapter

                    You can have at most two of these properties (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) for any shared data system.
                    There is no 100 always available system
                    Availability is the degree to which a system, product or component is operational and accessible when required for use. 
                    Availability Designs involve:
                    Availability in Series vs Parallel
                    Design Ideas (Separation of Concern, Fault Tolerance)
                    Redundancy (Vertical vs Horizontal)
                    Clustering (Active/Active vs Active/Passive)
                    Detect Failures (Pinging and Heartbeat)
                    Recover Service (Client-Based, Load Balancer, DNS Failover, Using Virtual IP)
                    Managing Session State (Client, Server in-memory, Database / Cache)
                    Analyzing Architecture Design for Availability
                    AWS Application and Network Load Balancer (Sticky Policy Configuration)
