AWS Cloud computing services are categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), with AWS managing the underlying infrastructure for IaaS and providing tools for PaaS and SaaS.. AWS Cloud computing services are categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), with AWS managing the underlying infrastructure for IaaS and providing tools for PaaS and SaaS.
The AWS shared responsibility model defines that AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and physical facilities), while customers are responsible for security in the cloud (applications, data, configurations, and access controls).. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS Cloud services. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the bare metal host operating system and hypervisor virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the services operate. The customer is responsible for security of everything they put in the cloud. The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit. The customer should also ensure that the network is configured for security and that security credentials and logins are managed safely.
"AWS manages the virtualization layer, including hypervisors, operating systems, and the physical security of data centers, ensuring compliance with global standards for infrastructure protection.. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate. AWS is responsible for the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, including: Physical security of data centers with controlled, need-based access; located in nondescript facilities, with 24/7 security guards; two-factor authentication; access logging and review; video surveillance; and disk degaussing and destruction."
Customers are responsible for securing their own applications, data, and configurations, including encryption, access controls, and patch management for operating systems and software running on AWS resources.. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit. The customer is responsible for securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources. The customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches). The customer is responsible for managing critical content security requirements, including: What content they choose to store on AWS... The customer is responsible for the VPC configurations that specify the network conditions in which the Amazon EC2 instance runs. The customer is responsible for S3 bucket access configuration.
AWS provides managed services like Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora, which handle database management tasks (patches, backups, scaling) for customers, reducing their operational overhead.. If the database runs as an Amazon RDS instance, then it is the responsibility of AWS to apply Oracle software upgrades and patches. Because Amazon RDS is a managed database offering, time-consuming database administration tasks—which include provisioning, backups, software patching, monitoring, and hardware scaling—are handled by AWS.
Customers must configure security groups, network settings, and VPC configurations to isolate and protect their resources, such as EC2 instances and databases, within AWS.. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. The customer is also responsible for the VPC configurations that specify the network conditions in which the Amazon EC2 instance runs.
Amazon S3 bucket access configurations are fully under customer control, requiring explicit permissions management to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.. S3 bucket access configuration? ANSWER: The customer
"Physical security of AWS data centers, including 24/7 surveillance, biometric access, and facility security, is managed entirely by AWS to protect customer resources.. AWS is responsible for the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, including: Physical security of data centers with controlled, need-based access; located in nondescript facilities, with 24/7 security guards; two-factor authentication; access logging and review; video surveillance; and disk degaussing and destruction."
Customers are responsible for applying operating system updates, security patches, and firewall rules (e.g., security groups) for EC2 instances and other compute resources.. The customer is responsible for selecting and securing any instance operating systems, securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources, security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management. The customer must manage the guest operating system (OS) that runs on the EC2 instance. Over time, the guest OS will need to be upgraded and have security patches applied. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance.
AWS manages the virtualization infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, Docker containers) and ensures the security of the underlying hardware and software layers, while customers manage application-level security.. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS Cloud services.
"For databases, if hosted on Amazon RDS (a managed service), AWS applies patches and upgrades; if hosted on EC2, the customer is responsible for database maintenance and security.. If the database runs on an EC2 instance, then it is the customer's responsibility to apply Oracle software upgrades and patches. AWS is responsible for... applying Oracle software upgrades and patches."
The customer’s responsibility includes encrypting data at rest and in transit, managing encryption keys, and ensuring compliance with data residency and privacy regulations.. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit.
AWS provides tools like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to help customers enforce granular access controls, but ultimate configuration and management are the customer’s responsibility.. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. The customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches). S3 bucket access configuration? ANSWER: The customer.
Customers must configure and maintain network security settings, including subnets, routing tables, and firewall rules, to protect their resources within AWS.. The customer is responsible for configuring the AWS firewall (or security group) that is applied to the Amazon EC2 instance. The customer is responsible for the VPC configurations that specify the network conditions in which the Amazon EC2 instance runs.
AWS’s security responsibilities extend to monitoring and maintaining the global infrastructure, including redundant systems, intrusion detection, and network segmentation, to ensure service availability and resilience.. AWS also continuously monitors the network at external boundaries, secures access points, and provides redundant infrastructure with intrusion detection.
Customers are responsible for ensuring the security of their applications, including code audits, vulnerability assessments, and secure coding practices, even when deployed on AWS.. The customer is responsible for securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources. Customer responsibilities include selecting and securing any instance operating systems, securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources, security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management.
AWS’s compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) ensure infrastructure security, but customers must implement additional controls tailored to their specific use cases and regulatory requirements.. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate. The customer is responsible for security in the cloud AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS Cloud services.
The shared responsibility model emphasizes that AWS secures the environment, while customers secure the data and applications within that environment, requiring collaboration between both parties.. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud Customer is responsible for security in the cloud The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS.
AWS provides managed services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS) that abstract infrastructure complexity, allowing customers to focus on application logic without managing underlying compute or storage.. AWS Lambda: Fully managed serverless compute... AWS manage the device node, OS execution environment and application/framework execution environment (e.g., JDK). You execute your programs within their application/framework execution environment. Amazon Elastic Container Services (ECS): Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers. Amazon ECS enables you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud... AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where AWS services operate.
Customers must ensure proper configuration of AWS services (e.g., IAM roles, VPC settings) to prevent misconfigurations that could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.. The customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches).
