"Use Elastic Load Balancers to distribute traffic and monitor metrics with CloudWatch"" is a good idea. Then, ""Idea 2: Elastic IPs ensure high availability by replacing failed instances without changing IP addresses"" would be another.. These load balancers send traffic to Amazon EC2 instances, and they can also send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which is a managed monitoring service. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address."
Use Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to distribute traffic across Amazon EC2 instances, monitor metrics via Amazon CloudWatch, and trigger Auto Scaling to scale resources based on demand.. The foundation of the web tier includes the use of Elastic load balancers in the architecture. These load balancers send traffic to Amazon EC2 instances, and they can also send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which is a managed monitoring service. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet.
Elastic IPs enable high availability by allowing replacement of failed EC2 instances without changing the IP address, ensuring consistent connectivity for applications.. An Elastic IP address is an IP address that can be assigned to any Amazon EC2 instance. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address. The diagram shows two separate clients: desktop and mobile. The clients are connecting to an application server. If that application server goes down, you can launch a new Amazon EC2 instance and assign the same Elastic IP address to it. This enables you to survive a server failure and not have to rewrite any code. Elastic IP addresses are very important because they allow us to mask the failure of an instance or software by allowing users and clients to use the same IP address with replacement resources.
Route 53 provides high availability through DNS failover, health checks, and routing policies (e.g., weighted round robin, latency-based, geolocation) to direct traffic to optimal endpoints.. Route 53 lets you track the health status of your resources and take action when an error occurs. It is straightforward to configure failover with Amazon Route 53. Route 53 supports simple routing in a single server environment, and it supports weighted round robin, which assigns the weights according to the desired access frequency. Route 53 also supports latency-based routing, which provides the fastest connection to the application. Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, or the origin of DNS queries. With DNS failover, Amazon Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack.
"DNS failover with Route 53 automatically redirects traffic to a static backup (e.g., Amazon S3) if the primary server (e.g., ELB or EC2) becomes unreachable, ensuring application continuity.. First, create two DNS records for the CNAME www with a routing policy of Failover Routing. The first record is the primary, and it points to the ELB load balancer for your web application. The second record is the ""Secondary"" route policy, and it points to your static Amazon S3 website. If something happened to the primary link, traffic would automatically be redirected to the static website that's hosted in the Amazon S3 bucket. With DNS failover routing, Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack."
Route 53 health checks verify the availability of endpoints (e.g., web servers, databases) by checking for specific strings in response content or other metrics, enabling dynamic failover decisions.. Note that for string matching, the health check looks for a particular string in the page body, within the first 5 KB of content. You could use string matching to confirm whether the DB instance is working by matching on a string that the page would contain only if it successfully connects to the DB. Route 53 health-checking agents will monitor each location or endpoint of your application to determine its availability. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack.
Multivalue answer routing in Route 53 returns multiple health-checkable IP addresses, improving availability and load balancing by distributing traffic across multiple resources.. Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Route 53 to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses so you can use DNS to improve availability and load balancing. With multiple answers, if you want to route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, you can create one multivalue answer record for each resource and, optionally, associate an Amazon Route 53 health check with each record.
Geolocation and geoproximity routing in Route 53 allow location-based traffic management, such as regional content delivery or biasing traffic toward closer AWS regions.. Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, or the origin of DNS queries. Geoproximity routing lets you route traffic based on the physical distance between your users and your resources if you're using Route 53 traffic flow. You can also route more or less traffic to each resource by specifying a positive or negative bias.
Weighted round robin in Route 53 enables A/B testing by assigning traffic proportions to different endpoints based on specified weights (e.g., 75% to a new server, 25% to an old one).. Weighted round robin allows you to assign weights to resource record sets in order to specify the frequency with which different responses are served. You might want to use this capability to do A/B testing, where you send a small portion of traffic to a server where you made a software change.
High availability requires redundancy, failure detection, and failover mechanisms across all components (e.g., databases, servers, networks) to ensure continuous operation during outages.. Route 53 lets you track the health status of your resources and take action when an error occurs. It is straightforward to configure failover with Amazon Route 53. With DNS failover routing, Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address. Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up. If the primary is up, all traffic will default to your web application stack. Route 53 supports health checks and DNS failover if the primary site becomes unreachable.
Elastic IP addresses and Auto Scaling work together to maintain application availability by replacing failed instances with new ones while preserving the same IP address for clients.. If that Amazon EC2 instance failed, a new Amazon EC2 instance could be launched with that IP address and the application does not require any changes as it will have the same IP address. if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet. The diagram shows two separate clients: desktop and mobile. The clients are connecting to an application server. If that application server goes down, you can launch a new Amazon EC2 instance and assign the same Elastic IP address to it. This enables you to survive a server failure and not have to rewrite any code.
Route 53 supports latency-based routing, directing users to the AWS endpoint (e.g., ELB, EC2) with the fastest performance, improving global application responsiveness.. Route 53 supports latency-based routing (or LBR) helps you improve your applicationâ€™s performance for a global audience. LBR works by routing your customers to the AWS endpoint (for example Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic IP addresses or load balancers) that provides the fastest experience based on actual performance measurements of the different AWS Regions where your application is running.
Health checks in Route 53 can validate specific strings in response content (e.g., a database connection success message) to confirm the operational status of critical backend services.. Note that for string matching, the health check looks for a particular string in the page body, within the first 5 KB of content. You could use string matching to confirm whether the DB instance is working by matching on a string that the page would contain only if it successfully connects to the DB.
Auto Scaling integrates with ELB and CloudWatch to dynamically adjust server capacity based on traffic patterns, ensuring resources scale up or down to meet demand.. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet.
High availability design principles include replication of data and infrastructure, redundancy of components, and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure resilience.. For each component -> if critical -> implement redundancy, detect failure and failover and design for replication. Route 53 lets you track the health status of your resources and take action when an error occurs. It is straightforward to configure failover with Amazon Route 53. Route 53 supports failover routing, which redirects traffic to alternate locations if the primary site is down. With DNS failover routing, Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. The foundation of the web tier includes the use of Elastic load balancers in the architecture. These load balancers send traffic to Amazon EC2 instances, and they can also send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which is a managed monitoring service. The metrics from Amazon EC2 and ELB can act as triggers, so that if you notice a particularly high latency or that your servers are becoming overused, you can take advantage of Auto Scaling to add more capacity to your web server fleet. Elastic load balancers will distribute traffic within a Region. If you want to go outside a Region, you have to use Amazon Route 53. The service is called Route 53 because DNS servers respond to queries on the User Datagram Protocolâ€”or UDPâ€”port 53. Route 53 is one of our only services that has a 100% availability service-level agreement.
Route 53 traffic flow policies enable complex routing strategies, such as combining multiple endpoints (e.g., regional servers) with weighted or latency-based prioritization for optimized user experience.. Route 53 supports weighted round robin, which assigns the weights according to the desired access frequency. Route 53 also supports latency-based routing, which provides the fastest connection to the application based on actual performance measurements of the different AWS Regions where your application is running. Geoproximity routing lets you route traffic based on the physical distance between your users and your resources if you're using Route 53 traffic flow. You can also route more or less traffic to each resource by specifying a positive or negative bias. With multiple answers, if you want to route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, you can create one multivalue answer record for each resource and, optionally, associate an Amazon Route 53 health check with each record.
