**Observer Pattern** – A design pattern where objects (observers) register themselves with a subject (publisher) to receive notifications when the subject's state changes. The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them when relevant events occur, enabling decoupled communication between objects.. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. Whenever an important event happens to the publisher, it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects. All subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. The publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification. The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher.
**Publisher-Subscriber Model** – The subject (publisher) broadcasts events to all registered subscribers (observers), allowing dynamic updates without hardcoding dependencies. This is ideal for systems like real-time data feeds or event-driven architectures.. The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. The subscription mechanism consists of 1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects and 2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list. All subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface.
**Subscriber Interface** – Subscribers must implement a common interface to handle notifications from the publisher. This ensures the publisher interacts with all subscribers via a standardized method, reducing coupling to specific subscriber classes.. all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification. subscribers must implement a common interface to handle notifications from the publisher. This ensures the publisher interacts with all subscribers via a standardized method, reducing coupling to specific subscriber classes.
**Dynamic Subscription** – Subscribers can join or leave the notification list at runtime, enabling flexibility in managing who receives updates. This is critical for systems like user preference systems or event listeners.. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to. You can establish relations between objects at runtime.
**Chain of Responsibility Pattern** – A behavioral pattern where requests are passed sequentially through a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain, enabling dynamic routing of tasks.. Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand. The pattern lets you link several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, 'ask' each handler whether it can process it. This way all handlers get a chance to process the request. Use the pattern when it's essential to execute several handlers in a particular order. You can control the order of request handling.
**Handler Decoupling** – Handlers in the Chain of Responsibility are standalone objects with a single responsibility (e.g., authentication, validation). This adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and allows reuse across different contexts.. each check should be extracted to its own class with a single method that performs the check. each handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. all handler classes implement the same interface... without coupling your code to their concrete classes.
**Request Flow Control** – Handlers can reject a request and stop further processing, ensuring that only relevant handlers act on the request. This prevents unnecessary work and improves efficiency..  a handler can decide not to pass the request further down the chain and effectively stop any further processing.  a handler decides whether it can process it. If it can, it doesn’t pass the request any further.
**Runtime Chain Composition** – Handlers can be dynamically linked or reordered at runtime, enabling flexible workflows. For example, an online ordering system might adjust security checks based on user roles.. Use the pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime. If you provide setters for a reference field inside the handler classes, you’ll be able to insert, remove or reorder handlers dynamically.
**Singleton Pattern (SoundPlayer Example)** – A singleton ensures a single instance of a class (e.g., SoundPlayer) for shared resources, preventing multiple instances from interfering. This is useful for system-level services like audio playback or database connections.. other singletons: consider SoundPlayer object
**Open/Closed Principle** – Both patterns align with this principle: new observers or handlers can be added without modifying existing code, allowing evolution of systems without breaking existing functionality.. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface). You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing client code.
**Event-Driven Architecture** – The Observer pattern is a core component of event-driven systems, where events (state changes) trigger actions in subscribed objects, enabling asynchronous communication.. Subscribers are notified in random order. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. Publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. The Observer pattern is a core component of event-driven systems, where events (state changes) trigger actions in subscribed objects, enabling asynchronous communication.
**GUI Event Propagation** – In GUIs, events propagate through a chain of objects (e.g., button → container → window), with the first handler capable of processing the event. This mirrors the Chain of Responsibility pattern.. For instance, when a user clicks a button, the event propagates through the chain of GUI elements that starts with the button, goes along its containers (like forms or panels), and ends up with the main application window. The event is processed by the first element in the chain that's capable of handling it. This example is also noteworthy because it shows that a chain can always be extracted from an object tree. The pattern lets you link several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, 'ask' each handler whether it can process it.
**State-Dependent Notifications** – Observers in the Observer pattern react to specific state changes in the subject, ensuring notifications are relevant to the observer’s needs (e.g., inventory updates for a customer).. Subscriber objects are notified when the publisher's state changes, ensuring notifications are relevant to their needs. The publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. Subscribers are notified in random order.
**Decoupling in Observer Pattern** – The publisher and subscribers are loosely coupled: the publisher doesn’t need to know the subscriber’s implementation, only that it conforms to the interface. This enhances modularity.. all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface you wouldn’t want to couple the publisher to all of those classes. Besides, you might not even know about some of them beforehand if your publisher class is supposed to be used by other people all subscribers implement the same interface
**Dynamic Handler Chains** – The Chain of Responsibility allows handlers to be inserted, removed, or reordered at runtime, making it adaptable to changing requirements or workflows (e.g., security checks in an API).. Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand. The pattern lets you link several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, 'ask' each handler whether it can process it. This way all handlers get a chance to process the request. Use the pattern when it's essential to execute several handlers in a particular order. Since you can link the handlers in the chain in any order, all requests will get through the chain exactly as you planned. Use the CoR pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime. If you provide setters for a reference field inside the handler classes, you'll be able to insert, remove or reorder handlers dynamically.
**Conflict Resolution in Patterns** – The Observer and Chain of Responsibility patterns address different challenges: the former handles state changes, the latter handles request routing, but both aim to reduce coupling and improve flexibility.. Either the customer wastes time checking product availability or the store wastes resources notifying the wrong customers. Subscribers are notified in random order. The code of the checks, which had already looked like a mess, became more and more bloated as you added each new feature. Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
**Singleton vs. Observer** – While singletons ensure a single instance, the Observer pattern enables multiple observers to react to a single subject. They are distinct but can coexist (e.g., a singleton publisher with multiple observers).. The object that has some interesting state is often called subject, but since it's also going to notify other objects about the changes to its state, we'll call it publisher. All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher's state are called subscribers. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to. e.g., a singleton publisher with multiple observers. Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface).
**Event Aggregation** – In complex systems, the Observer pattern can aggregate events (e.g., user actions, system logs) and distribute them to relevant subscribers, centralizing event management.. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. The publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. You can add the subscription mechanism to your buttons, letting the clients hook up their custom code via custom subscriber classes. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to.
**Error Handling in Chains** – The Chain of Responsibility allows handlers to handle errors (e.g., invalid input) and propagate them, ensuring robustness without requiring each handler to handle all possible failure scenarios.. Each linked handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. In addition to processing a request, handlers pass the request further along the chain. The request travels along the chain until all handlers have had a chance to process it.
**Adapter Pattern Intent** – Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, enabling incompatible classes to collaborate.. Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. ‘…convert the interface of a class into another interface …’ Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
**Adapter Implementation** – Uses object composition: an adapter class wraps an adaptee (existing class) and implements a target interface to bridge interface mismatches.. An object adapter relies on object composition: Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee
"**Adapter Example** – SAPService (send(Claim claim)) and CSystemAdapter (send(claim) via XML-to-JSON conversion) demonstrate interface translation between incompatible systems.. public class SAPService { public void send(Claim claim) { // some preocessing } } public class CSystemAdapter implements ClaimAdapterInterface { CSystemService nativeObject = new CSystemService(); public void send(Claim claim) { // send claims to C System nativeObject.send(claim.getItems(), claim.amount); } } An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate methods of a wrapped analytics object."
**Adapter Applicability** – Reuse legacy/3rd-party classes with incompatible interfaces, or dynamically add functionality to subclasses via adapters.. Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code. Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. You can’t use the analytics library “as is” because it expects the data in a format that’s incompatible with your app. An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.
"**Adapter Pros/Cons** – Simplifies interface translation but increases code complexity; adheres to Single Responsibility Principle but risks creating ""god objects"" if overused.. Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program. The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes it’s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code."
**Facade Pattern Intent** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, reducing dependencies and coupling between clients and subsystems.. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades.
**Facade Example** – Video conversion library facade (encode(filename, format)) hides complexity of underlying video/audio layers, offering a single method for clients.. Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality. For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format). After creating such a class and connecting it with the video conversion library, you’ll have your first facade. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.
**Facade Applicability** – Simplify access to complex subsystems, decouple clients from implementation details, or structure subsystems into layers with facades as entry points.. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability. Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem.
**Facade vs. Decorator** – Both simplify interfaces, but Facade focuses on external subsystems, while Decorator adds behavior to objects dynamically.. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. This approach looks very similar to the Decorator pattern.
**Facade vs. Mediator** – Both reduce coupling, but Facade abstracts subsystems, while Mediator coordinates interactions between multiple objects.. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades. For example, let’s return to our video conversion framework. It can be broken down into two layers: video- and audio-related. For each layer, you can create a facade and then make the classes of each layer communicate with each other via those facades. This approach looks very similar to the Mediator pattern.
"**Adapter vs. Facade Comparison** – Adapter bridges interface mismatches, while Facade simplifies access to a complex subsystem; both align with SOLID principles but serve different use cases.. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Adapter Implementation: ""…convert the interface of a class into another interface …"" Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. Facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Adapter can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Use the Adapter pattern when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem."
"**Adapter Example in Claims System** – CSystemAdapter translates XML data to JSON for the analytics library, enabling the stock market app to work with external systems.. Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee. Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee. public class CSystemAdapter implements ClaimAdapterInterface { CSystemService nativeObject = new CSystemService(); public void send(Claim claim) { // send claims to C System nativeObject.send(claim.getItems(), claim.amount); } }"
**Facade in Compiler Subsystem** – A facade shields clients from scanner, parser, and code generator classes, offering a unified interface to the compiler’s complex functionality.. Example: In a compiler subsystem, the compiler façade shields the client from the scanner, parser, stream, abstract tree and code generator classes Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.
"**Facade Pros/Cons** – Isolates code from subsystem complexity but risks becoming a ""god object"" if it accumulates too many responsibilities.. you can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app"
**Adapter and Facade in Practice** – Adapters handle data format conversion (e.g., XML→JSON), while facades abstract subsystems (e.g., video conversion library) for client simplicity.. You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it. An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.
**Adapter and Facade in SOLID Context** – Both patterns support Open/Closed Principle (add new adapters/facades without breaking existing code) and Single Responsibility Principle (separate interface logic from business logic).. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface. Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program. You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem. Facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.
**Adapter and Facade Use Cases** – Adapters for legacy system integration, facades for simplifying complex libraries (e.g., databases, frameworks).. Problem: Imagine you need to integrate an external codes (e.g. third party) to your existing codes. However, you realize the interfaces are not compatible and you cannot change the external codes. You start to do conditionals but it start to get messy with more external codes that are incompatible. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee. Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee. For example, the SAPService is using send(Claim claim) but the NativeObject is using send(claim.items(), claim.amount) Adapter Implementation Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework. Ordinarily, you’d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on. Facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. Facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format). Example: In a compiler subsystem, the compiler façade shields the client from the scanner, parser, stream, abstract tree and code generator classes
**Adapter and Facade Tradeoffs** – Adapters require precise interface mapping, while facades may over-simplify subsystems, leading to loss of functionality or flexibility.. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Create an interface of the adapter. Create concrete (adapter) class implementing the adapter interface. Let the adapter compose the adaptee. Implement the logic to adapt the adaptee. A facade may provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. Facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app. Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
"**Adapter and Facade in Real-World Scenarios** – Adapter: converting API data formats; Facade: wrapping a database layer to provide simple CRUD operations for clients.. You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it. The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects. Facade is a class that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality."
