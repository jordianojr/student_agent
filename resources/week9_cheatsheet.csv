Parameters in AWS CloudFormation define input values for templates, with optional default values, descriptions, and user-facing visibility in the AWS Console.. The only required attribute is Type, which can be String, Number, or CommaDelimitedList. You can also add a Description attribute that tells a user more about what kind of value they should specify. The parameter's name and description appear in the Specify Parameters page when a user uses the template in the Create Stack wizard. In this example, the InstanceTypeParameter specifies a default Amazon EC2 instance type of t2.micro, but users can choose from a t2.micro, m1.small, or m1.large instance type when they invoke the template. It also provides a description, which appears in the AWS CloudFormation Console when the template is launched.
Mappings provide conditional values for resources (e.g., AMI IDs based on AWS regions), enabling dynamic template behavior without code changes.. Mappings allow you to customize the properties of a resource based on certain conditions, which enables you to have fine-grained control over how your templates are launched. For example, an AMI ImageId number is unique to a Region, and the person who received your template might not necessarily know which AMI to use. You can thus provide the AMI lookup list using the Mappings parameter. This example contains a map for Regions. The mapping lists the AMI that should be used, based on the Region that the EC2 instance will launch in.
"Conditions allow templates to create or configure resources based on input parameters (e.g., environment type: dev, qa, prod), enabling environment-specific configurations.. You might use conditions when you want to reuse a template that can create resources in different contexts, such as a test environment versus a production environment. In your template, you can add an EnvironmentType input parameter, which accepts either “prod” or “test” as inputs. For the production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain capabilities; however, for the test environment, you want to use reduced capabilities to save money. With conditions, you can define which resources are created, and how they're configured for each environment type. When the previous template is applied to this example, only one set of resources in one Availability Zone is launched when the target environment is development, or DEV. When this template is used in production--or PROD—the solution launches two sets of resources in two different Availability Zones. So, without making a single change, you can get a redundant environment from the same template. In this example, the EnvType parameter specifies whether you want to create a Dev environment, a QA—environment, or a Prod environment. Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, such as which database it points to. You can use “Condition” to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment."
"The Resources section declares AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets) in a template, with multiple resources of the same type allowed and separated by commas.. The Resources section is required, and it declares the AWS resources that will be included or created in the stack, such as an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon Simple Storage Service –or Amazon S3—bucket. You must declare each resource separately; however, you can specify multiple resources of the same type. If you declare multiple resources, separate them with commas."
The DependsOn attribute ensures CloudFormation waits for one resource to be created before launching another (e.g., a database must be created before an EC2 instance).. The DependsOn attribute is an important attribute. DependsOn is how you specify that AWS CloudFormation should wait to launch a resource until a specific, different resource has already finished being created. In this case, there is an Amazon EC2 instance that can only be created after the database has been established. So, the creation of the Amazon EC2 instance depends on when the database is created.
Outputs capture values from a stack (e.g., DNS names, IP addresses) for post-deployment use, providing feedback on successful stack execution.. Outputs can specify the string output of any logical identifier that is available in the template. It's a convenient way to capture important information about your resources or input parameters. Outputs are values that are returned whenever you view the properties of your stack.
Templates should group related resources (e.g., VPCs, subnets, route tables) into separate templates for network, security, and application components.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles.
Network, security, and application resources should be isolated into distinct templates to enforce separation of concerns and reduce risk.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates. You don’t want to have too many things inside of one template across numerous applications. If you have an application template that supports only one application, changes to the template only affect that one application. If you have an application template that supports several applications, changes to the template will affect several applications, and the changes can cause all of the applications to be retested. we do not recommend sharing templates across management teams because different needs and standards can impact teams inappropriately Here's an example of how stack can be grouped with AWS CloudFormation groups. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles.
Avoid sharing templates across teams or applications unless centralizing control over specific resource types (e.g., IAM policies).. Avoid sharing a single template across applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type. we do not recommend sharing templates across management teams because different needs and standards can impact teams inappropriately
Security-focused templates should be stored in separate repositories to maintain isolation and reduce exposure.. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates.
Templates can be organized into categories (e.g., front-end, backend, shared services, base network, identity) to structure infrastructure logically.. Here's an example of how stack can be grouped with AWS CloudFormation groups. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles. A good guideline is to organize the resources like they are software. Think about the tightly connected components to your infrastructure, and put them in the same templates. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates.
"Production environments may require redundant resources (e.g., multiple Availability Zones) via conditional logic, while test environments use simplified configurations.. When the previous template is applied to this example, only one set of resources in one Availability Zone is launched when the target environment is development, or DEV. When this template is used in production--or PROD—the solution launches two sets of resources in two different Availability Zones. Your production environment and development environment must have the same stack in order to ensure that your application works the way that it was designed. Your DEV environment and QA environment must have the same stack of applications and the same configuration. The process of creating those environments manually can be error-prone. You can use a Conditions statement in the template to solve this problem. In this example, the EnvType parameter specifies whether you want to create a Dev environment, a QA—environment, or a Prod environment. Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, such as which database it points to. You can use ""Condition"" to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment."
Template grouping follows software-like principles, bundling tightly connected infrastructure components (e.g., a VPC template includes subnets, gateways, and ACLs).. Here's an example of how stack can be grouped with AWS CloudFormation groups. You could have front-end services like a consumer website, a seller website, or a mobile backend. There might be backend services for search, payments, reviews or recommendations. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. The base network could include VPCs, internet gateways, virtual private networks or VPNs, and network address translation or NAT. Finally, identity could include IAM policies, users, groups, and roles. A network resource template named “NetworkSharedTierVpcIgwNat.template” might include definitions for the following resources: VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, route tables, and network access control lists, or ACLs. A good guideline is to organize the resources like they are software. Think about the tightly connected components to your infrastructure, and put them in the same templates.
Templates should avoid being reused across multiple applications unless intentionally centralized, to prevent unintended side effects across projects.. While templates can be reused to create multiple environments or parts of environments, we do not recommend building all of an application's within one template. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Avoid sharing a single template across applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type. You don’t want to have too many things inside of one template across numerous applications. If you have an application template that supports only one application, changes to the template only affect that one application. If you have an application template that supports several applications, changes to the template will affect several applications, and the changes can cause all of the applications to be retested. For this reason, we do not recommend using a single template across multiple applications.
AWS CloudFormation supports per-template limits for service quotas, enabling scalable and predictable infrastructure management.. The new per template limits, predictable, and scalable manner.
Templates for shared services (e.g., monitoring, logging) should be decoupled from application-specific templates to ensure consistency and reusability.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates. Shared services could include customer relationship management databases, common monitoring, alarms, and subnets. Avoid sharing a single template across applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type.
Environment-specific templates (e.g., dev vs. prod) use conditions and parameters to adapt resource configurations without duplicating template logic.. you might use conditions when you want to reuse a template that can create resources in different contexts, such as a test environment versus a production environment In this example, the EnvType parameter specifies whether you want to create a Dev environment, a QA—environment, or a Prod environment. Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, suchity which database it points to. You can use “Condition” to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment Conditions are evaluated based on input parameter values that you specify when you create or update a stack. Within each condition, you can reference another condition, a parameter value, or a mapping The EnvType parameter specifies whether you want to create a Dev environment, a QA—environment, or a Prod environment. Depending on the environment, you might want to specify different configurations, suchity which database it points to. You can use “Condition” to evaluate this, and specify appropriate resources for each environment When the previous template is applied to this example, only one set of resources in one Availability Zone is launched when the target environment is development, or DEV. When this template is used in production--or PROD—the solution launches two sets of resources in two different Availability Zones
Security resources (e.g., IAM policies, access control lists) should be isolated in dedicated templates to minimize exposure and enforce strict access controls.. Security resources, you might want to lock them down by separating them from the rest of your templates. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates.
Template versioning and isolation are critical for managing changes across environments, ensuring stability and traceability in production.. Resources should be grouped into templates based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At a minimum, you should separate network resources, security resources, and application resources into their own templates. Avoid sharing a single template across applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type. Consider storing templates that contain security resources in a separate repository from other templates. While templates can be reused to create multiple environments or parts of environments, we do not recommend building all of an application's within one template.
