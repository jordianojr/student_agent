6,10,MC,Mixed 1,"Consider an online video streaming platform that serves millions of users globally. To provide a seamless viewing experience, the platform uses both caching and prefetching techniques. The caching strategy caches popular videos near the edge servers to quickly serve them to nearby users, while the prefetching strategy preloads some segments of videos that users are likely to watch next. However, during peak hours, users report buffering issues and the analytics reveal a reduced cache hit rate. As a system architect, what should be your course of action to address this issue?",Ignore the problem as buffering is common during peak hours and it doesn't significantly affect user experience.,False,0,qn60
